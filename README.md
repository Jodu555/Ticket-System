# Ticket-System
A highly configurable and usable Ticket System for every Kind of Support 

## Description
This should be an modular Ticket System for me and all Kinds of Product's i've build / i will build
To Manage / Fix and Cartegorize all kinds of Bugs or whatever with an Integration for all my products
Especially the Ez-Uploader, my Personal Website, the Hosting-System, the github-information-api
Too have a Dedicated place were all the Bugs and or Ideas Belong to

## Think - User Tracking
Think of a way to implement this also in the hoster system without a new account! 
To have a DEDICATED place where all the tickets are stored
* The Idea is to use this as a Rest API and pass a UUID to a ticket so it can determent the user
So the tickets can also displayed on the HostingSystem UI for example
